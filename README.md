# Python sensor synchronization

This project were created for my thesis where I am researching ECGs.

In this project, I developed a method for synchronizing ECG data collected by sensors using timestamp data collected 
by sensors and a mobile phone. As you can see from the image in the PDF file, the data collected by the three sensors 
was synchronized very well.
